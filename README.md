# Project-Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
This project is one of the guided projects I did on datacamp after taking introduction to python and intermediate courses. I performed exploratory analysis of some entertainment data. The project is divided into 10 parts, they are:
# Project tasks
  * Loading a friend's data into a dictionary
  * Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
  * A visual inspection of our data
  * Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
  * Filtering for movies!
  * Creating a scatter plot
  * Digging deeper
  * Marking non-feature films
  * Plotting with color!
  * What next?
